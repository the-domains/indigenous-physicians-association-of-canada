# Becoming a Doctor

Becoming a doctor is a long process.  Most medical school require that you complete a 3- or 4-year undergraduate degree prior to starting medical training, but this can vary.  Some medical schools have specific prerequisite courses, while others have only suggested courses, and others have no preference at all.  Because most medical schools require that the[Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT)][0]to be written, many students choose undergraduate classes that will help them prepare for this exam.

The application process is different at each medical school.  The best source of information in the University website, and the Admissions Office.  In general, you can expect the following to be included in your application:

> * Educational history (including university transcripts)
> * Employment history
> * Extracurricular activities
> * Volunteer experience
> * MCAT results
> * Reference letters
> * Personal statement letter (not all schools)

Medical school is typically a four-year program, however there are some 3-year programs ([University of Calgary][1],[McMaster University][2]).  Following medical school, doctors complete a Residency Program in the specialty of their choice.  The duration of residency depends on the specific specialty (eg. 2 years for family medicine).  Some go on to complete Fellowships or other degrees.
