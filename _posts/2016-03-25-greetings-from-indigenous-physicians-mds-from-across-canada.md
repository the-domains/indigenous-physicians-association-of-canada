Greetings from Indigenous Physicians, MDs from across Canada who share a common mission to improve the health of Indigenous Peoples and enhance the role of Indigenous Physicians in health provision, design and setting priorities.  We collaborate with physicians in training and practice, other health professionals, communities, agencies, and governments to ultimately improve Indigenous health.

Past successes have included the development of medical school admissions toolkits to increase Indigenous health professionals in training; mentoring activities to support Indigenous medical students, residents and physicians; and the creation of curriculum to improve competencies in Indigenous Health for all health professionals. Following our National Mentorship Forum and General Council, held in November 2015, we have become rejuvenated and energized to release our upcoming three-years strategy at the 2016 NMF/GC in Vancouver, BC.

Our members remain engaged with medical schools and residency programs, teaching others on the social determinants of health, the historical and political context and cultural elements which influence Indigenous health status. Cultural competency and cultural safety form the basis of this knowledge which will help health professionals to effectively care for Indigenous patients, families and communities.

IPAC continues to actively collaborate with the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, the College of Family Physicians of Canada and Indigenous communities to carry out these initiatives across the country.
