Greetings from the **Indigenous Physicians Association of Canada**, the national voice for Indigenous physicians.  For over two decades we've organized in various forms to address the ongoing health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples in Canada.

As President of **Indigenous Physicians**, it is my pleasure to lead the organization into 2016 which will be a year of change and growth for both ourselves and Indigenous health.

With the release of the [Truth and Reconciliation calls to action][0] on health, we have a modern rallying cry to gather support to finally eliminate these disparities.  With new momentum towards solving old problems, we feel there is an opportunity to do something different.  Several fundamental variables have shifted since we first organized nearly two decades ago,

* 1\.  There are _hundreds_ of Indigenous physicians across Canada and _thousands_ of Indigenous health providers.

* 2\. Indigenous patients are telling their own stories, in very effective ways.

* 3\. The reality of what gaps exist between Indigenous and non-Indigenous health systems are more clear and transparent than ever before.

As Indigenous physicians, our role is not to speak for patients but to speak with them.  **Indigenous Physicians** exists to ensure that we are prepared to advocate and provide care in a way that is patient-centred, trauma-informed and decolonized.  Together we can make a difference, because we must make a difference.  The status quo is not acceptable.

Meegwitch,
