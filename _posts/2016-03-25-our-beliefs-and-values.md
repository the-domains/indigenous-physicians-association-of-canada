# Our Beliefs & Values

IPAC's beliefs and values originate from communities, our ancestors and the teachings found within our cultures. We believe that Indigenous People deserve the best health possible. We honour the wholistic view of health (body, mind, spirit and heart) including traditional knowledge and practices. We believe that Indigenous physicians are honoured with positions of trust in the communities and commitment to our responsibilities are reflected in our work.

We value respectful and ethical interactions among all individuals, organizations and groups with whom we work. We hold the following values as most important as they originate from traditional teachings.

**_Love_**-- of people, communities and Indigenous ways of being

**_Respect_**-- for knowledge, wisdom, communities and each other

**_Courage_**-- to stand up for our ways of being and the application and integration of indigeneity in all things we do as an organization

**_Honesty_**-- among the membership and staff and with the organizations and individuals with whom we work

**_Wisdom_**-- use of traditional teachings to approach our way of being and with our work

**_Humility_**-- to know our limitations and to seek guidance when necessary

**_Truth_**-- to always speak the truth as an organization and to speak the truth within  each other
